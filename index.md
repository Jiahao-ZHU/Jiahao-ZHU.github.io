# About Me

<img src="https://jiahao-zhu.github.io/jiahaozhu.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Jiahao Zhu (朱 加昊)**.

I am a research master majoring in **Management Science & Engineering** at Sun Yat-sen University, China. My concentration is consumer behavior. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zengxiang Chen][1]. If you want to find more details about me, here is [my CV][2] (last updated in May 2023).

## Research Interests

My current research aims to construct a conceptual, even computational model of **emotional dynamics in verbal expression**, and develop a novel method to automatically analyze them from text data. Thus, my broader research interests lie in the **psychological formal model** (for a glimpse, see [Borsboom et al., 2021][3]) and **network psychometrics** (for a brief review and discussion, see [Borsboom, 2022][4]).
