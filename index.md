# About Me

Greeting! Here is **Jiahao Zhu (朱 加昊)**.

I am a research master majoring in **Marketing** at Sun Yat-sen University, China. My concentration is consumer behavior. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zengxiang Chen][1]. If you want to find more details about me, here is [my CV][2] (last updated in May 2023).

## Research Interests

My broader research interests lie in the **psychological formal model** (for a glimpse, see [Borsboom et al., 2021][3]) and **network psychometrics** (for a brief review and discussion, see [Borsboom, 2022][4]). 

In detail, my current research aims to construct a conceptual, even computational model of **emotional dynamics in verbal expression**, and develop a novel method to automatically analyze them from text data. The ultimate goal of this topic is to have a deeper understanding of why people express emotion and thus help people regulate their expression.

Regarding my ideal research, I’d like to introduce Dr. Dalege and his colleagues’ insightful work ([2023, preprint][5]). This paper proposed a formal model of intra- and inter-personal beliefs. The most attractive point is that it draws on statistical physics concepts like spin, energy, and temperature to depict belief systems and their dynamics. 

I wish to explore the potential of psychological formal models and their practical implements on our well-being.
