# NOTES
Language/语言: **English** (current) | [中文][1]

<br />
I will share some **organized personal academic notes**, mainly focusing on understanding academic concepts and examples.

<br />
According to the Feynman learning method, I will try to make my notes as easy to understand as possible. Please note, however, that these are **only my personal notes**, and my understanding **may not apply to in-depth research on some specialized issues and even be problematic and erroneous**. If you want more insight, please see the original papers I reference in the note.

<br />
Hoping my note may help you to some extent. And If you find any problems or have any comments on my notes, please feel free to contact me by email!
