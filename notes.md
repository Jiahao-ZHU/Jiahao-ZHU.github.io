# NOTES
Here, I will share some **organized academic notes**, mainly focusing on some academic concepts and mathematical formulas to understand and examples.

<br />
According to the Feynman learning method, I will try to make my notes as easy to understand as possible. Please note, however, that these are **only my personal notes**, and my understanding **may not apply to in-depth research on some specialized issues**. If you want more insight, I will include possible papers in my notes for reference.

<br />
Hoping my note may help you to some extent.
